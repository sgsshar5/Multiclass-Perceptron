# Multiclass-Perceptron

Implemented multi-class perceptron algorithm. Performed multiple operations on the train and test perception model.
Performed operations :
1:Implemented a binary perception.
2: Used the binary perceptron to train classifiers to discriminate between
•class 1 and class 2,
•class 2 and class 3, and
•class 1 and class 3.
and then reported the train and test classification accuracies for each of the three classifiers after
training for 20 iterations. 
3:Extended the binary perceptron that you implemented in part 3 above to
perform multi-class classification using the 1-vs-rest approach. Reported  the train and test
classification accuracies after training for 20 iterations.
4: Added an l2 regularisation term to your multi-class classifier implemented in
part 3. Set the regularisation coefficient to 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0 and compared the train
and test classification accuracies.
